🖼️ Dashboard Showcase
1. Executive Overview
The landing page features core KPIs: Sales ($746K), Growth (21.4%), and Profit ($292.30K) with a minimalist aesthetic.

2. Custom Pop-out Navigation
A "Clean UI" approach using Bookmarks to hide/show an advanced sidebar for Region, Ship Mode, and Customer filtering.

3. Dynamic Model Switching
Interactive navigation allows users to cycle through vehicle models (Audi, Lexus, Land Rover) which updates the visual context.

🛠️ Technical Implementation
DAX Modeling: Used SUMMARIZE functions to create dynamic category tables and Time Intelligence for YoY analysis.

UI/UX: Implemented a selection-pane-based carousel for car model switching.

Visual Stack: * Donut Charts: Booking channel segmentation (Direct, Third Party, Pre-Book).

Bar Charts: Service category analysis (Replacement vs. Servicing).

Trend Lines: Monthly sales seasonality tracking.
